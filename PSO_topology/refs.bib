    abstract = { Cognitive networks have evolved a broad range of solutions to the problem of gathering, storing and responding to information. Some of these networks are describable as static sets of neurons linked in an adaptive web of connections. These are ‘solid’ networks, with a well-defined and physically persistent architecture. Other systems are formed by sets of agents that exchange, store and process information but without persistent connections or move relative to each other in physical space. We refer to these networks that lack stable connections and static elements as ‘liquid’ brains, a category that includes ant and termite colonies, immune systems and some microbiomes and slime moulds. What are the key differences between solid and liquid brains, particularly in their cognitive potential, ability to solve particular problems and environments, and information-processing strategies? To answer this question requires a new, integrative framework. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Liquid brains, solid brains: How distributed cognitive architectures process information’. }

    abstract = { Brains are composed of connected neurons that compute by transmitting signals. The neurons are generally fixed in space, but the communication patterns that enable information processing change rapidly. By contrast, other biological systems, such as ant colonies, bacterial colonies, slime moulds and immune systems, process information using agents that communicate locally while moving through physical space. We refer to systems in which agents are strongly connected and immobile as solid, and to systems in which agents are not hardwired to each other and can move freely as liquid. We ask how collective computation depends on agent movement. A liquid cellular automaton (LCA) demonstrates the effect of movement and communication locality on consensus problems. A simple mathematical model predicts how these properties of the LCA affect how quickly information propagates through the system. While solid brains allow complex network structures to move information over long distances, mobility provides an alternative way for agents to transport information when long-range connectivity is expensive or infeasible. Our results show how simple mobile agents solve global information processing tasks more effectively than similar systems that are stationary.

abstract = "For constrained optimization problems set in a continuous space, feasible regions might be disjointed and the optimal solution might be in any of these regions. Thus, locating these feasible regions (ideally all of them) as well as identifying the most promising region (in terms of objective value) at the end of the optimization process would be of a great significance. In this paper a time-adaptive topology is proposed that enables a variant of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to locate many feasible regions at the early stages of the optimization process and to identify the most promising one at the latter stages of the optimization process. This PSO variant is combined with two local searches which improve the ability of the algorithm in both finding feasible regions and higher quality solutions. This method is further hybridized with covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) to enhance its ability to improve the solutions at the latter stages of the optimization process. Results generated by this hybrid method are compared with the results of several other state-of-the-art methods in dealing with standard benchmark constraint optimization problems."

abstract="This paper introduces a new algorithmic nature inspired approach that uses a hybridized Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm with a new neighborhood topology for successfully solving the Feature Selection Problem (FSP). The Feature Selection Problem is an interesting and important topic which is relevant for a variety of database applications. The proposed algorithm for the solution of the FSP, the Particle Swarm Optimization with Expanding Neighborhood Topology (PSOENT), combines a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) strategy. As, in general, the structure of the social network affects strongly a PSO algorithm, the proposed method by using an expanding neighborhood topology manages to increase the performance of the algorithm. As the algorithm starts from a small size neighborhood and by increasing (expanding) the size of the neighborhood, it ends to a neighborhood that includes all the swarm, it manages to take advantage of the exploration capabilities of a global neighborhood structure and of the exploitation abilities of a local neighborhood structure. In order to test the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method we use data sets of different sizes and compare the proposed method with a number of other PSO algorithms and other algorithms from the literature.",

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a new variant of particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely PSO with increasing topology connectivity (PSO-ITC), to solve unconstrained single-objective optimization problems with continuous search space. Specifically, an ITC module is developed to achieve better control of exploration/exploitation searches by linearly increasing the particle's topology connectivity with time as well as performing the shuffling mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a new learning framework that consists of a new velocity update mechanism and a new neighborhood search operator that aims to enhance the algorithm's searching performance. The proposed PSO-ITC is extensively evaluated across 20 benchmark functions with various features as well as two engineering design problems. Simulation results reveal that the performance of the PSO-ITC is superior to nine other PSO variants and six cutting-edge metaheuristic search algorithms."

title = "An effective co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization for constrained engineering design problems",
abstract = "Many engineering design problems can be formulated as constrained optimization problems. So far, penalty function methods have been the most popular methods for constrained optimization due to their simplicity and easy implementation. However, it is often not easy to set suitable penalty factors or to design adaptive mechanism. By employing the notion of co-evolution to adapt penalty factors, this paper proposes a co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization approach (CPSO) for constrained optimization problems, where PSO is applied with two kinds of swarms for evolutionary exploration and exploitation in spaces of both solutions and penalty factors. The proposed CPSO is population based and easy to implement in parallel. Especially, penalty factors also evolve using PSO in a self-tuning way. Simulation results based on well-known constrained engineering design problems demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness on initial populations of the proposed method. Moreover, the CPSO obtains some solutions better than those previously reported in the literature.",
